I'm hooked on a number of instruments and plugins that I've purchased over the last year or so for the iPad auv3 ecosystem, with more and more desktop apps being ported to the smaller device, there is a big range to choose from. To be honest, considering that iPadOS is very similar now to MacOS, there is not a lot of difference apart from one is a touch driven device and the other is not.

I've been using AUM and Loopy Pro a great deal to explore the musical possibilities they offer and I'm being quite productive with these tools.

You may or may not know that I also have a blog on Hive, I am starting to write content here for my personal blog first because it's all comitted to Github and deployed to Netlify. The markdown code can easily be copied and pasted to Hive where I can earn crypto. Or sometimes I might do it the other way round, to copy Hive content into this site.

My image and audio files are now gradually being moved to IPFS where I can share the links as part of blog content, it's just so easy and is also free.

I decided to build a sound library, so look out for this tag [#soundlibrary](/tags/soundlibrary) throughout the site.

Anyway the plugin I want to write up about in this post is called Other Desert Cities by Audiodamage and this post will take a little while to write because I want to push this plugin to the max, to share a number of audio examples, yes, using IPFS to achieve this very goal. Once I've got enough information written up, I'll publish the post which I started on 16th March using the future posting mechanism in Astro, which essentially makes use of a Github action to deploy.
