## Astro Themes
Astro have recently added themes to their framework and I decided to adopt one of them. I want this site to be very simple, easy on the eye and not have any distractions. So Astro Ink turned out to be the best option.

I'll adapt it over time of course, make it more mine, add some extra sections to the pages.

## Svelte
SvelteJS is a new one on me but I am happy to learn it!
