Warning: This recording is dreadful but it's quite amusing, I promise to restring the guitar and tune it properly for future recordings lol!! 

By all means report me to the RSPG (Royal Society for the protection of guitars) but I wanted to test that I had an audio feed via my audio interface (Minifuse 4) to the iPad/Mac, plus I could record it.

This evenings task is to re-string and tune the guitar properly!

On the technical side of things, I used an app called Durin to share the recording made on the iPad to IPFS. I then chucked the link into Notion to share with my desktop, then pasted that into this blog post. I've got 3 or 4 different ways now to upload to IPFS and share via my various web presences whether on nicklewis.blog, peakd.com/@nicklewis or octodon.social/@nicklewis
