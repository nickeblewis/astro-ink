I have been using AUM for awhile, a superb iOS app that works on both the iPhone and iPad. Sadly for Android users there is no version on your OS, which is a shame to be honest. I hope that changes in the future. That said there are other apps that are cross-platform, I'll talk about those too sometime.

I have been scanning through my recordings folder for sharing something here, here you are, will write more later on the tools I use, gotta dash out. Teach me for starting a post with little time to spare.

Hope you enjoy the sample above on IPFS!
