Good afternoon, picking up from where I left off in my last post, I am writing this post to go out on both https://nicklewis.blog and on https://hive.blocktunes.net/@nicklewis and posting the associated files on the IPFS via https://NFT.storage, the start of a big project, that I'll describe as it evolves. I am curating a sound library, that is being written to the blockchain.


The story starts in 2020-21, the first year or so of the Covid lockdowns, where many people rediscovered old passions of theirs, for me, one of them was music and the beauty of hooking up a dusty old controller keyboard to my computer, eventually leading to me buying some new gear not so long ago, the old musical fire reignited and my passion for writing about it likewise.

Here are two comps I created in September 2021, which I rediscovered only today in my recordings folder.

The first is a bit of an exploration of the sounds played on the keyboard and the second was the piece I settled on in the end. It could go well with some other instrumentation perhaps and I will "evolve" it, like I do with all of the projects I keep. I go back and add further layers until I'm done, which can take a very long time!!
