            Ok time for a better Bio! 
            
            I am a developer (or softwareengineer programmer if you prefer) who nowadays concentrates on javascript frameworks such as vuejs and so on so forth.

When not programming I am very much into composing music using Bitwig, Vcv, Ableton 

I love the outdoors and engaging in lots of photography and kayaking, walking and generally exploring places near and far. 

I am based in the lovely county of Berkshire, England and have never ventured far from the area, hopping over to hampshire and back for a number of years. Live with my wife and our two kids have left the roost to start their own families. We are proud (quite young) grandparents to two beautiful girls.
