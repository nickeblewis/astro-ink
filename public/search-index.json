Now it's just 14 minutes from home. Lots of photos. I took 96!","tags":["hampshire","roman","photography","history"],"body":"\nOn Fridays during August we have the afternoon off, so that we can spend more time with our families outdoors and step away from our desks. I chose to go for a photo walk and I shall do the same for the next few weeks and hope to find a whole bunch of new places to explore along the way.\n\nThe title gives the game away here! I chose to take a walk around the Roman Wall at Silchester, the entire circuit, carrying a bottle of water, as the temperature was a chilly 23 Celsius, compared to near 30 today.\n\nCalleva Atrebatum was an Iron Age oppidum, the capital of the Atrebates tribe. It then became a walled town in the Roman province of Britannia at a major crossroads of the Roman roads of Britain. The modern village of Silchester in Hampshire, England, is about a mile to the west of the site.\n\n## St Mary the Virgin, Silchester\n![](../../images/_DSC1829.jpeg)\nLooking for perspectives in photography leads to many different possibilities, as I had tried the other angle where you look along the pews but that hadn't worked in this case. So I tried this angle, I wanted to pick up on the prayer cushions.\n![](../../images/_DSC1830.jpeg)\n\n![](../../images/_DSC1835.jpeg)\nIt is documented that this 12th Century Christian church was built on a pagan site and prior to that, some 1100 years beforehand would have been part of Roman Silchester. Some of the materials used to build the church were borrowed from the nearby Roman wall.\n![](../../images/_DSC1837.jpeg)\n\n## Waking the Roman Wall\n![Sheep of the Serengeti](/images/_DSC1842.jpeg)\nThe scene reminded me of foreign climes, which these days, seem more familiar than ever before with every, field, garden and park looking as parched as the desert. You see landscapes like this in all of the hot places,Spain perhaps but in those cases you would most likely see more goats than sheep!\n\n![](../../images/_DSC1844.jpeg)\n\n![](../../images/_DSC1845.jpeg)\nLooking out across this field, I imagined how it must have looked as a town. There have been many excavations on this site since the Victorians began digging places up from Hadrian's Wall down to Herculaneum, Italy. My Wife and I once came across a dig that was taking place on the far side of the field pictured above. It was very fascinating. I can recall it being a hot summer much like this one, they had a number of gantries set up across trenches where walls and streets could be seen. Just small sections of them, as the Archaelogical team are given an area so big to measure out and down they dig. A little bit of poetry there for you!\n\nMany of the finds can be seen at Reading museum, if you get the chance to go, do go, look out for the Eagle!\n ![](../../images/_DSC1846.jpeg)\n\n![](../../images/_DSC1847.jpeg)\n\n\n![](../../images/_DSC1848.jpeg)\nThe last photo in this set, is of the same tree and section of the wall that I photographed in November 2021 when it was bare and the landscape looked very different. \n![](../../images/_DSC1849.jpeg)\n\n![](../../images/_DSC1850.jpeg)\n\nI always enjoy going for the close-up shots. More often than not there is a lot to see in these mini-landscapes than there may be in the wide vistas around you. It's all part of the story we tell as photographers, a part of the narrative.\n![](../../images/_DSC1856.jpeg)\nI was trying to capture the impressions this section of the wall presented to me, as having \n![](../../images/_DSC1858.jpeg)\n\n![](../../images/_DSC1859.jpeg)\n\n![](../../images/_DSC1862.jpeg)\n\n![](../../images/_DSC1863.jpeg)\n\n![](../../images/_DSC1864.jpeg)\nAt first they were ignoring me and then all of the sudden they realised that they were on camera and posed. I think initially they were being sheepish... ok, I'll stick to photography and not stand-up comedy...\n![](../../images/_DSC1866.jpeg)\nI love this one, it's got a nice flow and elements to it. If only the sky was more inspiring.\n\n![](../../images/_DSC1867.jpeg)\nThe berries were looking plentiful but we've had no rain for a long time, so they may not be any good for human consumption this year. More for the wildlife I guess?\n![](../../images/_DSC1868.jpeg)\nI was fascinated by the sign here for the [Camino Ingles](https://caminoways.com/camino-ingles/) which is a long distance pilgrimage route to Santiago de Compostela in Spain. I've long been fascinated by this, long before there have been two celebrity shows on British TV in connection with it.\n![](../../images/_DSC1884.jpeg)\nI was having some trouble taking photos handheld in the shady wooded section of my walk. Maybe my camera is playing up or was it just the craftsman blaming his tools. Anyway I cranked up the ISO a tad and grabbed some pictures of the wall from it's base. You can see the blend of materials here, stone, flint and some sand for the mortar. The reason for this would have been because both the Romans and the Iron age tribe worked together in developing the town and it's defensive wall.\n![](../../images/_DSC1888.jpeg)\n\n![](../../images/_DSC1890.jpeg)\nThis photo is a bit naff, but I took it to try an show the ditch, which 2000 or so years ago would have been about another 2 feet deeper. This follows the walls circumference, I believe the whole way around, most definitely a big proportion of it.\n![](../../images/_DSC1904.jpeg)\nThe old tree growing out through the wall. Q: Is the tree as old as the wall? A: I don't know lol!\n![](../../images/_DSC1908.jpeg)\n\n![](../../images/_DSC1910.jpeg)\n\n![](../../images/_DSC1912.jpeg)\n\n![](../../images/_DSC1916.jpeg)\n\n![](../../images/_DSC1917.jpeg)\n\n"},{"slug":"adding-vue-to-your-astro-site","category":"posts","title":"Adding Vue to your Astro based site","description":"Learn how to add more than one framework to your Astro site as I needed to do just this recently","tags":["astro","Vue","programming"],"body":"One of the super-powers that Astro has, apart from being super fast in it's rendering, is the ability to mix front-end frameworks. Many of it's rivals, only allow the use of one framework at a time and for me that was getting a bit tough, as in my line of work, I get to work with various frameworks. I am working with Vue nowadays more than any other but Gridsome, a great project in it's own right, isn't moving forwards. Gatsby is incredible but that is tied to React.\n\nSo I was very excited when Astro came along and here we are, I've chosen it as the backbone of this website.\n\n## Lets add Vue\n```bash\nyarn astro add vue\n```\n\nModify your ``astro.config.js`` file\n\n```js\nimport { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';\n\nimport react from '@astrojs/react';\nimport preact from '@astrojs/preact';\nimport svelte from '@astrojs/svelte';\nimport vue from '@astrojs/vue';\nimport solid from '@astrojs/solid-js';\nimport lit from '@astrojs/lit';\nimport alpine from '@astrojs/alpinejs';\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  integrations: [react(), preact(), svelte(), vue(), solid(), lit(), alpine()],\n});\n```\nThe above is an example and you'll only need to add the ```import``` directive for Vue, followed by the ```vue()``` reference in your integrations. leaving your config file as it is otherwise.\n\nNow to test that this new integration works.\n\n## Build a Vue component\nI decided to add a new component to my components folder called ```Test.vue```, which looks like this.\n\n```js\n<script>\n  export default {\n    data () {\n      return {\n        count: 100,\n        name: 'Test',            }\n      }\n  };\n</script>\n\n<template>\n    <p>We have {{count}} biscuits left</p>\n</template>\n\n```\n## Add a new page\nThen I created a new page called ```testpage.astro```, which looks like this\n\nNext we want to add this to an existing page, such as one of my posts, which are under ```post.astro```\n\n```js\n---\nimport Test from '../components/Test.vue';\n---\n\n<Test />\n```\n\nI've pushed my example up to the server, so click on [this link](https://nicklewis.blog/testpage) and you'll see it. A simple example but now, I can write components for this site using Vue which is essential, as I will be writing about it a lot here and want to share some examples!\n\n## Where from here?\nWell, the sky is the limit, I would like to build some components, some specifically for this site and others that you could use.\n\nI want to add a sound component for playing audio files which will include a transport, a track position slider and some other features. That I can build using Vue and then can import it wherever it's needed in the content."},{"slug":"astro-frontmatter-snippet","category":"posts","title":"How to create a frontmatter snippet in VS Code","description":"How to create snippets for your markdown in Visual Studio Code to save time and reduce typographic errors","tags":["astro","visual studio code"],"body":"\nI needed to speed up the way in which I start a new article on this blog as I always find myself referring to an old article to copy and paste the frontmatter across, which has become a bit annoying and tedious.

Can I photograph them all? I doubt it, as I don't get to travel as much as I would like and besides what is \"travel\" in these strange times we are living. So it will have to be a lifelong project in any case.\n\n## setting constraints\n\nA friend of mine has been running a similar project in his country (Malta) [Muddy Boots](https://jabriffa.wordpress.com) and had set himself some constraints, one of those being to stick to external shots only. Right now this is all that I am able to achieve anyway. Covid has forced most churches to stay closed with the exception of private prayer here in England. Some churches aren't always open to the public under normal circumstances. So for now, most of my photos will be taken from outside!"},{"slug":"deep-selectors-in-vue","category":"posts","title":"Deep Selectors in Vue","description":"What are deep selectors and how to use them in Vue scoped SASS","tags":["Vue","CSS","SASS"],"body":"\nI wanted to write a few really brief posts where I pick just one subject about Vue or other similar topics.

It is a truly incredible part of Farnborough and is somewhat understated. How British!\n\n## What you will learn\n\nWhilst the walk isn't going to be a workshop as such I will talk about the ways in which you can photograph large buildings, to really get up close and study them from a variety of different angles. Larger buildings can be tricky to capture as a whole and photographers tends to capture photos that are more record shots than anything else. I think that is a shame, as sometimes great ideas are missed. Learn to see in a different way.\n\nWe will visit each of the buildings below from the outside and come away with photos that perhaps we wouldn't have considered taking previously. \n\n## Balloon Hangar\n\n![](/images/_DSC7832.jpg)\n\n> Construction of the portable airship hangar originally began in March 1912. It is made up of 112 riveted lattice frames, each weighing half a ton, and bolted together to form the 260-foot long structure. The building  stood at Farnborough as a single structure only in 1912 and 1913. The hangar was recovered by  the Farnborough Air Sciences Trust (FAST) restored to its former glory and then re-erected by Slough Estates Group in order to form the centrepiece of the  business park created out of the refurbishment of the former Royal Aircraft Establishment site. It stands as a permanent monument commemorating the enormous history of World class aviation research and development at Farnborough.\n\nThe hangar is an imposing structure, not all that easy to photograph as it happens. I have seen some great photos of it over time but a lot of them follow a similar theme, even mine have been much the same. How can we capture something refreshingly different? Maybe you can? \n\n## Building Q120\n\n![](/images/_DSC7883.jpg)\n\n> This is all that remains of the Sea Plane Tank; the building originally housed the end of a quarter mile long water tank, approximately 2 meters deep by 2 meters wide. A vestigial ‘stub’ of the tank – since filled in – can still be seen but the Business Park development has now replaced rest. The tank was once fully enclosed; accurate scale models of sea and float plane hulls were lowered from a moving test carriage above the tank in very carefully controlled experiments designed study their behaviour in varying water surface conditions, speeds and angles. Land based aircraft ditching characteristics were also extensively tested in order to assess performance and buoyance in the event of an emergency landing on water.\n\nI will talk a little bit about some of the key principles in photographic composition, such as perspective, lead-in lines and the \"rule of thirds\". Tools that help improve your photography a great deal.\n## Building Q121\n\n![](/images/_DSC7890.jpg)\n\n> Construction of the building began in 1931 and was completed in 1935; at the time it was one of if not the largest wind tunnels in the World. Q121 is usually referred to as the ’24 foot wind tunnel,’ it was originally designed to create a cylinder of high quality precisely controlled air flow 24 feet in diameter. This was created by 30 foot diameter a six bladed fan, each blade made from laminated mahogany. Q121 was in operation until 1994 and is a Grade 1 listed building.\n\nSometimes it's all about the angle and the light, that can lift an image and make it really stand out.\n\n ## Building Q134\n\n ![](/images/DSC00151.jpg)\n\n> The Hub building at the Business Park is one of the few remaining original buildings from the Royal Aircraft Establishment era; although it has been modified with the addition of the ‘control room’ on the upper most level in order to make it appear as though it was once the terminal building, this was never the case. In the later years of the RAE it was the home of the Space, Missiles and Guided Weapons Department. Today, as well as being the Business Park Headquarters, it also houses the National Aerospace Library.\n\n## Building R52\n\n![](/images/_DSC0863.jpg)\n\n> Dating from 1907 this is the oldest wind tunnel building on the former RAE site and originally housed two ‘wind channels’ as the earliest designs were known. The building contains the wooden 4’x 3’ ‘Low Turbulence Wind Tunnel; constructed in 1946 entirely from ‘Douglas Fir’ and designed to deliver extremely high quality air flow. Among many other things, the tunnel was used to test early delta wing designs during the development of high speed flight. The building was also used as the ‘expert evaluation location’ when the Antiques Roadshow paid a visit to Farnborough.\n\n## Cody Statue\n\n![](/images/temp-2-2.jpg)\n\n> Originally an American Citizen, Samuel Franklin Cody was a pioneer of early British aviation; the inventor of many and ingenious large kites with military applications He is also the designer and pilot of Army Aeroplane number 1A which performed the first flight of a powered aeroplane in the UK on October 16th 1908. He took off from a location marked by a memorial stone very close to the Aviator Hotel and can be said to be the Father of aircraft development at Farnborough. Cody was also a renowned Wild West showman and is often mistakenly identified as William Cody - the more famous Buffalo Bill – from whom he certainly took inspiration. Cody was killed in a tragic accident at Farnborough in 1913 when his aircraft suffered structural failure while flying at an altitude of some 400 feet, his final resting place can still be seen in the Aldershot Military Cemetery.\n\n## FAST Museum\nWe will finish the walk at the FAST Museum, for which more information can be found here:\n\nhttps://airsciences.org.uk/\n"},{"slug":"future-posts","category":"posts","title":"Future Posts","description":"How to deploy scheduled posts","tags":["astro"],"body":"\ndraft but see the details on https://github.com/one-aalam/astro-ink "},{"slug":"going-electric","category":"posts","title":"Going Electric?","description":"In 2021 we set out to find our first electric car which required a lot of test drive bookings!","tags":["Technology","EV","electric vehicles"],"body":"Today we visited the EV Experience Centre in Milton Keynes and took a good look at Volkswagen’s new ID.4 SUV.

Hope you all had a lovely Christmas and have recovered from your NY celebrations?\n\n![Follow the road!](../../images/_DSC2131-2.jpg)\nOne of my favourite photos from last year, was the one above. It was taken deep in the Surrey Hills as Autumn kicked in. I had to take it quite quickly, as I was either going to be run over by a bunch of thirsty cyclists or something else. They are lethal those cyclists!\n\nI'll do a retrospective post soon of photography, so I shall come back to that suject another time.\n\nAnyway, let's dive into the main subject!\n\nLet's get down to it! Let's kick off the new year :-)\n\nThis year, I am going to write more about coding covering both visual and audio topics. So for today I want to introduce you to \"livecoding\" which in essence is the concept of coding on-the-fly, and quite often to share the experience with others. Just imagine writing code live on stage to perform music. Kind of DJ meets programmer, well that is literally what it is.\n\nSo far I've been learning about 2 different applications, Sonic-Pi and Tidal Cycles, the latter runs off another product called Supercollider.\n## Sonic Pi\nI'll leave this bit to Underjord and in future posts, I wlll jam for you ;-)\n\nI love Sonic-Pi and I recently wrote about it on Substack but let me share what I wrote over there:\n\nI feel as if I’ve been sitting under a rock for a decade. I’m a highly experienced software engineer/programmer/developer with a wealth of experience spanning pretty much close to three decades. Now that is a scary thought. I thought I knew about many things coding wise, well I clearly don’t. How on earth have I never come across SonicPi!\n\nTurns out there are a whole host of other products much like it and I’ll come back to those.\n\nSonicPi was created by Sam Aaron, who wanted to create a musical programming tool that would help teach school children and beyond. It’s now used by 1.5 million people from school age and professional artists alike.\n\nI came across this tool via my Mastodon account, yes like many people, I have jumped ship from Twitter, though I’ve not shut down the latter. One of the people mentioned it and so off I trotted to YouTube, where I found a bunch of videos recorded by Sam and one or two professional performers who use SonicPi on stage.\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/suH_goWVBeA\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OLLwG_SN8oo\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/YvsoWehBbec\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nAs you can see there are a lot of resources online for you if you want to get into it. However I want to give it a go, get my teeth properly into it.\n\n### Lets give it a go\nThe first thing I did was to download SonicPi for my Mac, it came out on Linux originally but quite recently was released on Mac and Windows.\n\nSo I grabbed a copy from\n\nhttps://sonic-pi.net/\n\nSomehow after following the excellent tutorial, I created this:\n\n```\nuse_bpm 60\n\nlive_loop :kick do\n  sample :bd_haus, rate: 1\n  sleep 0.5\nend\n\nlive_loop :snare do\n  sleep 0.5\n  sample :sn_dolf\n  sleep 0.5\nend\n\nlive_loop :hihat do\n  sample :drum_cymbal_closed\n  sleep 0.25\nend\n\nlive_loop :bass do\n  use_synth :prophet\n  play :E1, release: 3\n  sleep 2\nend\n\nlive_loop :bleep do\n  use_random_seed 123\n  4.times do |i|\n    16.times do\n      use_synth :beep\n      play chord(:E3, :minor).choose, attack: 0, release: 0.1, cutoff: rrand_i(50, 90) + i * 10\n      sleep 0.125\n    end\n  end\nend\n\nlive_loop :chords do\n  use_synth :blade\n  [1, 3, 6, 4].each do |d|\n    (range -2, 2).each do |i|\n      play_chord (chord_degree d, :e, :minor, 3, invert: i)\n      sleep 2\n    end\n  end\nend\n```\n\nIn the above example we’ve 6 loops/tracks running in parallel, if you look at the start of each “live_loop”, they are assigned with a name and then within either use a synth or a sample and either slice elements of a sample or play a series of chords.\n\nIt gets very clever when you change the parameters for any of the above instruments in the code, to tweak the knobs on the synth. I noticed in some of Sam’s videos he’s connected controllers and external instruments such as a Moog or some DAW software to play virtual instruments you already own. Now that is worth exploring, as I’ve tonnes of those.\n\n### Randomisation in music\nOne of the beauties of programming is that you can iterate (loop) through a series of values, you can randomise, you can mathematically adjust parameters, such as cutoff frequencies over a period of time. It’s a perfect marriage.\n\nHere is another example:\n\n```\nlive_loop :multi_beat do\n  use_random_seed 2000\n  8.times do\n    c = rrand(70, 130)\n    n = (scale :e1, :minor_pentatonic).take(3).choose\n    synth :tb303, note: n, release: 0.1, cutoff: c if rand < 0.9\n    sample :elec_hi_snare if one_in(6)\n    sample :drum_cymbal_closed if one_in(2)\n    sample :drum_cymbal_pedal if one_in(3)\n    sample :bd_haus, amp: 1.5 if one_in(4)\n    sleep 0.125\n  end\nend\n```\n\n## Tidal Cycles\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ji0OS9VqfU0\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n### Installation Supercollider and then Tidal Cycles\nSetting up Tidal Cycles is beyond the scope of this post, it wasn't too difficult to set up, I managed it in the end! The following guide worked for me:\n\nhttps://tidalcycles.org/docs/getting-started/macos_install/\n\nIt's worth noting that I already had Supercollider installed but the above script will install it.\n\nThe Atom editor has recently been sunset by GitHub, a new fork called Pulsar has been initiated but for me, I prefer to use Visual Studio Code but the choice is yours.\n\nIf you do decide on VSC, you'll need to install the extension for it, which you'll find via the etensions panel in VSC.\n\nSo there is a bit of pain involved here in terms of set up but it's worth it in the end.\n\nLet's get the whole thing up and running!\n\n### Step 1 - Running Supercollider\nHaving started Supercollider, you'll need to launch Superdirt the sound module that Tidal mostly uses, though it's possible to use others I believe, I haven't progressed that far yet.\n\nType the following in, to launch it:\n\n```\nSuperDirt.start;\n```\n\n\n### Step 2 - Launch VSC and create a Tidal file\n\n```\nd1 $ s \"bd sd\"\n```\nPlace the cursoe on the first of the above lines and press CMD+Enter and you should hear a beat playing.\nThen to stop it, place the cursor over hush and CMD+Enter to silence it.\nLaunch the music!\n\nSomething more complex\n\n\n```\ndo\n  d1\n    $every 4 (rev)\n    $sometimesBy 0.2 (slow 2)\n    $sometimesBy 0.8 (jux (iter 8))\n    $stack\n    [\n      sound \"ifdrums(3, 8, 0)\",\n      sound \"bd(3, 8, 3)\",\n      sound \"glitch(2, 8)\"\n    ]\n    #n (irand 64)\n    #pan (rand)\n    #lpf (rangex 800 18000 $slow 4 $sine) #resonance \"0.2\"\n    #delay \"0.3\" #delaytime \"1.125\" #delayfeedback \"0.5\" #lock 1\n    #gain \"1.3\"\n  d2\n    $sometimesBy 0.3 (jux (rev))\n    $sometimesBy 0.2 (slow 2)\n    $s \"supersaw(3, 8)\"\n    #note \"c4'sus4\"\n    |+| note \"[0, 7][7, 14][14, 21][7, 0]\"\n    |+| note \"[0, 7, 12]\"\n    |+| note \"0\"\n    #lpf (range 1000 8000 $rand) #resonance \"0.2\"\n    #sustain \"0.08\"\n    #gain \"1.0\"\n    #room \"0.1\" #size \"0.4\"\n\n    hush\n```\n### Recording music to audio files\n### Some examples to whet our appetites\nThe simplest example, is a drum pattern comprising of bass and snare drums.\n\n### Mutable Instruments\nI was sad to learn that MI are going to close down as a business, for they make a range of Eurorack modules that have been popular with many people. I've been using the software versions with VCV Rack. Recently they've been open-sourced by the founder of MI, so it's possible to use them in conjunction with Supercollider (and by definition, Tidal Cycles).

It's a living draft, that I will tweet every time I update it, so I welcome your feedback over there on anything you'd like to know more about that fits any of the subject headings below...\n\nThe idea behind this blog is to write about anything that fascinates me, it is a bit selfish perhaps but I hope at least some of my scribblings are useful to other folks out there. It will mainly be about Tech, from Javascript subjects to modular synths, which ok is a slightly different thing but it's still programming of sorts.\n\nI like to think of this as a process of curation, due to the fact I read a lot, learn from others, throw in my own ideas and share with you.\n\n## Jamstack to Hive (similar to EXXP)\nIf you haven't heard of Hive the [blockchain](/tags/blockchain) and the blogging platform that forms a big part of it, then this is not the place to learn about it, I will find some links for you to read that do a better job at the introductions. \n\nHowever I want to figure out a method that does a similar job to the product called EXXP. EXXP helps you automatically publish posts on Wordpress to Hive. So the question is, can I run a script that publishes content I've written for this [JamStack](/tags/Jamstack) site to Hive?? That way I could write in one place and a cron job takes care of the rest, that way posts like this could then earn themselves some Hive. That would be ace!\n\nYou may like to take a look at a few Hive profiles to see what it is all about, starting with my very own:\n[Nick Lewis on PeakD](https://peakd.com/@nicklewis), \n[TDCTunes](https://peakd.com/@tdctunes), \n[Nicky Havey](https://peakd.com/@nickyhavey) who incidentally uses EXXP, so all of his content is written on Wordpress and gets synced to Hive, \n[Steevc](https://peakd.com/@steevc), \n[LivingUKTaiwan](https://peakd.com/@livinguktaiwan) and last but not least \n[My favourites feed](https://peakd.com/@nicklewis/favorites) which pulls in a very eclectic mix of posts.\n\nAnyway Hive gets it's own [Hive tag](/tags/Hive) on this site, for a collection of articles on that very subject.\n\n## Indieweb and the Digital Garden\nThis site is on the Indieweb web-ring and follows many of the principles of being Indie but what does this actually mean beyond just not using Wordpress, Ghost etc for building and hosting online content?\n\n## WTF are Microformats and why the xxxxx should I care?\n## The lesser known HTML tags\n## Subscribing and subscription platforms\n\n## Monetizing vs earning\n\n## Documenting Javascript\nI work with JS every day and I come across stuff I don't use often that other developers in the team do. I find myself thinking, why the heck don't I use that method? Is it because I am set in my ways and the younger crowd know more than I do? Should I be annoyed about this? Or should I just bite my tongue and learn from them?\n\nYes he is a stubborn piece of work at the best of times... (my wife wrote that sentence)\n\n## Exploring UI and UX\n\n## Making bleeps and blurps\nI explore synthesis with a number of software products (hopefully some hardware soon too), so shall be writing more about that here, check out my [music tag](/tags/music) for this. That said, what can I achieve using [Javascript](/tags/javascript) and the multi-talented thing that is the web browser?\n\n## Webmentions\nYou will notice that my posts feature webmentions, maybe not on this one yet, click on the \"Tweet this\" blue button in the footer to share and you'll see your like appear on this page, though maybe not straight away, as I have to run a daily build to pick up new webmentions; but more on that later.\n\nThink of Wedmentions as being a way to either comment on a piece of content, this can be via content on other websites, Twitter being a great example and supporter of this concept.\n\nI'm working on this, so that if say, you Tweet this article, then other people comment and a conversation unfolds, we would want to render that activity on this page as if they were comments with replies, just like a thread appears on Twitter with the exception that we've re-styled that data to match the site."},{"slug":"improving-webmentions-on-this-site","category":"posts","title":"Improving webmentions on this site","description":"I spotted an amusing bug with my webmentions on the site, where a person appears to be doubling up","tags":["astro"],"body":"\nIt looks like David has liked my article twice which is not possible, you can only like a tweet or a post on this site once.

It works very nicely but then I thought, what if I store stuff on IPFS directly? What if NFT.storage went out of action or shut their services down? I'd be scuppered!\n\nA few years ago I intalled IPFS desktop on my previous Mac and I installed the software on my current machine, the files I'd uploaded in the past were still there, of course they were, as when you create a node on the IPFS, it remains there.\n\nHow does IPFS work exactly? I'll come back to that question later but first I wanted to see if I could use IPFS directly rather than NFT.storage to store my files, that way I could use my own file naming system, create my own folders to organise things as best as possible. Will it work with images and audio?\n\nYes, it does, it works brilliantly.\n\nHere are a few photos from recent years that I uploaded the first time I tinkered with IPFS and I've started to add more, now I am happy that this method works.\n\nWhy use IPFS as opposed to other cloud hosting options? The short answer is it's not centralised, it's free, there is redundancy, if one node goes down, it doesn't matter, there are others to back it up. Upload once share many times, as I can quite literally copy the markdown code from this blog post and paste it into PeakD for a HIVE version of this post.

What do I want to get out of it? What do I want to learn and discover?","tags":["music","modular"],"body":"\nI enjoy learning and then teaching other people both my old and new knowledge with some interesting responses along the way. Many old colleagues of mine know I like to learn, sometimes through trial and error. After all that’s what programming is all about, whether I’m writing JavaScript code or messing around with modular synths, which I’m delighted to say is the focus of this newsletter issue today.\n\nI will talk more about the studio at the end, but first, I’ll talk you through how I built the patch in the video, plus some ideas for how it could be evolved.\n\n## What the Bernoulli?\nThe video above, you may have already watched it or perhaps you prefer to read the text first, video after; demonstrates how you can take a hi-hat pattern (rhythm) and create a tool to vary it.\n\nSo I fired up MiRack on the iPad which is based on the Eurorack modular systems you can physically build, you will have seen these in performances and concerts, if you are anything like me, an EDM geek!\n\nThe software (virtual) equivalent of the hardware is stupidly cheap at £12, whereas to build a physical version it can cost thousands! So it’s great that I can experiment freely in the virtual environment without worrying about spending a lot of money on real modules. I hope to buy the real thing though but the plan is to gain an understanding in software first, to establish which modules I’d buy and that I’ve got some template patches to use as reference points.\n\nFor the video; My aim was to create a closed hi-hat pattern with a bit of variation to it and I used a Bernoulli Gate for the task and ended up chaining 3 of them together.\n\nLet’s zoom in on these, here is a picture of what they look like:\n\n![](/images/4e7dfe3d-fd4f-4167-ac53-61b62565a968_2388x1668.png)\nThere are 3 above, each has an input, two outputs and a rotary dial. So what I’ve done here is to feed my sequencer’s output into the first Bernoulli and the dial has determined that output A will be more likely, not much, than the B output. These two outputs feed into the other two gates which in turn work in the same way.\n\nAll of the gates are connected to the four drum modules, so what happens is they all play in time but with each hit, the sound is randomised. So one moment we hear an 808 beat, then a 909 or we can play the same sound each time but with a different level output, yo provide a humanised velocity across all notes played.\n\nThe outcome being a more interesting hi-hat pattern. I demonstrate in the video how these parameters could be tweaked in a performance to create lots of interesting outcomes in the music but they could be programmed too. I shall get on to that in future newsletters.\n\nWe could of course take this concept even further by building up the system to include other sound generators, effects and a whole lot more. So we shall come back to this to share some more ideas.\n\n## Studio building\nI want to keep it small because my office will double up as the studio, so most of the gear needs to be desktop sized. If needs be I would look at swapping my desk for something different, to accommodate a larger number of instruments plus my regular computer setup for work.\n\n### What do I have right now?\nMy MacBook Pro, this iPad from which I’m writing this newsletter and an old Yamaha Keyboard. I plan to sell the Yamaha and replace it with an Arturia Keystep Pro which right now will work with the iPad and Mac via a MIDI connection. Then I will start expanding from there with an Audio Interface, monitor speakers and my first piece of modular/semi-modular hardware but what will that be?

I am curating a sound library, that is being written to the blockchain.\n\n\nThe story starts in 2020-21, the first year or so of the Covid lockdowns, where many people rediscovered old passions of theirs, for me, one of them was music and the beauty of hooking up a dusty old controller keyboard to my computer, eventually leading to me buying some new gear not so long ago, the old musical fire reignited and my passion for writing about it likewise.\n\nHere are two comps I created in September 2021, which I rediscovered only today in my recordings folder.\n\nThe first is a bit of an exploration of the sounds played on the keyboard and the second was the piece I settled on in the end.

I go back and add further layers until I'm done, which can take a very long time!!\n\n### Track 1 - The exploration\n<audio controls>\n  <source src=\"https://bafybeibkvzpw6npyffstdnelf7nxkzuzr6nb6g7koej5l2heeg2f7w6ugq.ipfs.nftstorage.link/\" type=\"audio/mpeg\">\n  Your browser does not support the audio element.\n</audio>\n\n### Track 2 - The final version, shorter\n<audio controls>\n  <source src=\"https://bafybeigd7etzbv6ltqazsmxtchjkrf3txkklooskhjpqnf5fca27o6wqwm.ipfs.nftstorage.link/\" type=\"audio/mpeg\">\n  Your browser does not support the audio element.\n</audio>\n\n## Apps used\n\n- http://kymatica.com/apps/aum\n- https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/noise/id1011132019\n- https://apps.apple.com/us/app/kb-1-keyboard-suite/id1437919435\n- https://apps.apple.com/us/app/riffer/id1435691909\n\nThis post has also been published at https://hive.blocktunes.net/@nicklewis/hive-sound-library-string-and-horns"},{"slug":"transplant-diary","category":"posts","title":"Transplant Diary","description":"The diary I wrote in 2008 during the time I was being treated for renal failure. I ended up needing a live transplant. All worked out well in the end though","tags":["personal","journal"],"body":"\nIn the year 2002 I ended up in hospital for 3 days and it was a total shock. One minute I considered myself to be healthy and normal, the next I was on my way to hospital. What on earth was going on? I wasn't even ill.\n\nIt all came about when I went to see my GP for a health check. Our family had all been as requested by our new GP who had joined the practice. I was busy at the time looking for a new job, as I had been made redundant a month or so before this particular time. I wasn't unwell and didn't see the need to take them up on their offer.\n\nReluctantly I booked an appointment and they booked me in for the last session of the day, just before 6pm. Ironically this \"pointless\" appointment in fact saved my life. Had I not gone, I would have, how can I put this... not been alive today.\n\nI can remember that evening well. The GP took my blood pressure and was baffled by how high it was. He initially suspected the electronic BP monitor (also known as a sphygmomanometer) and tried a manual meter instead. Nope, same issue, sky high blood pressure. \"Are you feeling ok Mr Lewis? Any health concerns, light headedness, anything at all?\", he asked. I was puzzled by the question and I must confess at the time blood pressure meant very little to me. I'd never had it checked before.\n\nHe hastily wrote a note, detailing his findings, popped it into an envelope and handed it to me. \"You are going to need to go to hospital, here is a note with your details and my findings this evening, please hand this over to the duty nurse when you get there. I will let them know.\" I asked if I could go the following day, sounds daft now but I had no idea how much danger I actually was in, which was reinforced by the GP when he replied, \"You need to go now, go home and gather some clothes for the night, toiletries etc and get someone to take you\".\n\nThat was that - I ended up in hospital for 3 days whilst my blood pressure was stabilised but it begged the question. What was causing this problem? Was my heart the issue? Was I going to, you know, errm, die? Thankfully the staff at the hospital were great and put my mind aat rest, keeping me in the medical assessment ward until they were satisfied things were more under control. I was not going to peg it, it could be fixed!\n\n6 years after those 3 days, I ended up having a transplant as it took a long time to get to the bottom of my hidden problem, the illness with no major symptoms. \n\nI had a variety of tests over about 2-3 years, including chest x-rays, endiograms, MRI scan and biopsies. I saw a cardiologist initially who ruled out all possibility of my blood pressure being caused by any form of heart defect. So where next? There was just one possibility, high blood pressure can be triggered by kidneys, especially if there was evidence of a \"protein leak\" which was evident in a urine test. I was referred for further investigation.\n\nI underwent more tests, this time with a renal focus, one of which was a biopsy, perhaps the most gruelling experience I've ever endured in my life. I will spare you the details but this test nailed it. I really had a serious problem, the biopsy revealed scarring of my kidney tissue, a condition known as Focal Segmental Glomerusclerosis or better known in medical circles as FSGS. \n\nWe then needed to plan ahead, my Creatinine (the protein I mentioned earlier) was climbing slowly upwards. Would I need to go on dialysis? \n\nI had by this point in time come under the care of Dr Andrews, who remains my Nephrologist to this very day. A change of diet kept things under control for a number of years but in the end, my kidney function deterioated significantly almost overnight.\n\nDr Andrews recommended that a transplant would be the only option.\n\nA lot happened but I am going to jump to the diaries I wrote in 2008... This is just an extract from them. I've not read them much since I wrote them, so this is the first time I've done that in all of these years. So starting with one long blog article with extracts from the diary. I may break it down better when I get time. If this is of interest to you, email me or follow me on Twitter, address on the site.\n\n## 2nd September 2008 - A new lease of life\nPreparing yourself for a major operation is a big task. Not just in the sense of making various arrangements with work, family, relatives, friends, doctors, hospitals; but also with oneself. The mental preparation is something that you just do, it ticks over in your head. I am now at the time of writing this blog entry only two weeks away from undergoing some pretty amazing surgery. A live kidney transplant, our surgeon will be taking a kidney from my Dad as the donor and transplanting it into me. This incredible young surgeon has performed somewhere near 200 of these operations over the past few years. Its routine, they have already mapped the two of us patients out, like a road atlas and already know where to go in, what to aim for and how best to go about doing it. Its mind bogglingly amazing. Its miraculous science. To think that in the year I was born (1972) none of this would have been thought of, people with kidney disease had to put up with dialysis machines or worse. Then came the very early transplants where organs were donated by cadaveric means, in other words the misfortune of someone's death led to the regeneration of someone else's life. I truly believe many more people should carry donor cards with them, after all in the event of your death, you don't need your organs any more. So many more lives could be saved. This led to the pioneering surgical exploration that proved that a living, healthy person could donate a kidney to somebody who was in dire need of a new one. Since then many more transplants are carried out every year, I have learnt that a staggering number of people in this country do have similar problems to me in varying degrees of severity. Why am I writing about something that's perhaps quite personal? Why not? I hope that my scribings will be of interest to other people who are going through a similar experience and to raise awareness of what has been coined \"The Silent Killer\". Kidney disease can of course be fatal, the same as any other organ failure. The problem is there are precious few warning signs. I for one didn't wake up one morning feeling ill and in fact I still don't feel ill now. That is because in many ways I am one of the lucky people, my condition was diagnosed early when I had my blood pressure checked during a random check-up. I had various tests including an MRI scan, chest x-rays, blood tests, urine tests and a biopsy pinpointed what they suspected. I have a condition called FSGS or to use its full name - Focal Segmental Glomeru Schlerosis (hope I spelt that right Doc!). This in simple terms means that I have a lot of scarring around my kidney tissue, the stuff that makes up the organ as a whole. This has a detrimental effect on their ability to filter blood and as a result, protein levels etc rise. Medication can for a period of time control this along with a controlled diet. So for a few years I have kept myself as lean and as fit as possible. I have made some sacrifices such as giving up some foods I love, cutting out beer and other alcoholic drinks (although I still drink wines sometimes). Weight is critical as the surgeon can quite literally postpone plans if neither patient is in a fit state to operate on. In the future, once this is all over, I shall return to writing about photography and other such things and very soon I will have 6-8 weeks off at home to recover. Which means plenty of time to write!\n\n## 9th September 2008 - Blogging like mad!\nWell I have been steaming along a bit on the blog recently and today's post is going to be a briefer one. My thoughts are now focussed more on the task that lies ahead in the very near future. That is to go to hospital with my Dad, both of us will go into theatre (thankfully out for the count), Mr Surgeon does his stuff, we come around and then its down to us to get better with a little help from the medical people! Sounds quite easy when put in this perspective and hopefully it will be. I do feel nervous though but I do know and trust that the surgical team will do a fantastic job. Got to keep positive! My Dad said to me, \"All we have to do is turn up and they will take care of the rest\". Indeed that is pretty much it really, we are simply passengers on an incredible ride. It will be quite strange having Dad there alongside me for the duration, what am I putting him through?! Can't think like that though, got to just accept that this is the way its done, there is no other option other than dialysis. So far I have managed to avoid that and fingers crossed could keep it that way. My Dad and I have done our own preparation for this in our minds and we have received help and advice from various people. I must say that the whole process has been flawless and the NHS cannot be faulted at all. Our transplant nurse is an amazing, hard working woman and my Mum has become convinced she does some of the operations too! My Consultant has been open and honest, at times downright blunt too as its all too easy to become bliase about the condition I have. I don't feel ill, therefore i can eat, drink or do what the hell I like. Wrong! I have to be careful and I have made sure that I have along the way. Thanks also to my Wife, family and friends who have all been positive about it, even joking about it from time to time, after all humour is often a very good tonic at difficult times. I would have lost the plot by now, if it wasn't for them. Did I say today's post was going to be brief? Well in that case I shall leave it there for now. More later....\n\n## 7th October 2008 - Brief update\nNow at the hospital bloods done and need to wait for results . So chilling out as much as I can in the hospital cafe. Croissant and tea! I will be twittering for most of the day and you can view there little updates on the right hand side of the blog homepage, facebook, friendfeed, plaxo or twitter itself! I an very well syndicated! It also helps kill the time as boredom is worse than any pain in my mind.\n## 7th October 2008 - Going ok\nWell I am blogging from a hospital bed and need to remain flat on my back until about 1830 which is about as exciting as watching day time telly. I am feeling ok and the earlier pain has gone. Imagine being kicked hard in the stomach by a donkey and you get the idea.\n## 8th October 2008 - Biopsy - What is it exactly?\nNow it's over and done with, I can write about it without too much psychological trauma! Now if you are squeamish, hate readng about surgical procedures, you may best be advised to read no further than this paragraph. Well done you are still with me! I had my biopsy done at about 12pm yesterday. They inserted a Cannula into one of the veins of my left hand, in order to administer an IV drip of fluid. I believe the fluid was a blood thinning agent of some sort to help relax the blood as it passes through the kidney or something like that. Then they moved my bed to an adjoining private room to begin the procedure. I had to lie flat and straight on the bed throughout the surgical process, incidentally I had to sign a consent form beforehand and they do outline the risks involved which are unlikely to happen (and they didn't in my case). I was attended to by a team of two, one consultant and a senior nurse whom I have got to know pretty well over the past month. The consultant didn't waste any time and he got down to business very quickly, swabbing some cold antiseptic gel over the area upon which he was about to work on, my lower belly basically. Then he uses an ultrasound scanner which has more of the gel on its sensor to analyse the area of my abdomen and the transplanted kidney that lies beneath it. My transplant is on the right hand side, lower abdomen, just next to my stomach in a cavity where there is some space and where they can easily \"plumb\" it into my bladder. Having taken a good look at the kidney, he commented on how good it was looking and that it is working away very evidently. Now comes the yucky bit! They use local anesthetic to numb an area of the skin, then press the needle down further so that it penetrates through to the kidney and apply another dose of the treatment there too. This does briefly sting like a wasp's sting but isn't too bad. The numbness is sharp and profound though and my whole belly felt as if it was paralysed, quite a weird sensation. The consultant uses the ultrasound to find his way. Next up, he gets out a tool that looks something like you would buy from a DIY store (sort of). The device is part needle, part, errrr, \"grabber\" I guess is the only way I can really describe it! He then used this to got through the hole he had made in my belly, to reach for the surface of the kidney and \"CLUNK\", he has a little piece of my kidney which goes into a little pot! I could hear gasps of admiration for my kidney sample from the nurse, \"Wow that's a really beautiful piece of kidney!\", she exlaimed. \"How could it look nice?\", I ask in a very restrained way (it hurts to talk when your belly is very numb and there is a hole in it!). They repeated this twice more! Finally after a little bit of cleaning up around the puncture wound he had made in me! They applied some pressure to stem the bleeding, dressed it and then placed a saline pack on top to apply weight to the area and that was that. I was then wheeled back to the ward and remained flat on my back for the next 6 hours! The pain was quite accute for awhile, it felt as if I had been punched in the stomach by a hard nutter whom I had foolishly picked a fight with in a Pub brawl. However an hour later this started to ease off and I was feeling a lot more comfortable. I kept myself amused with my brace of gadgets (Ipod, phone with mobile internet) and tucked into Richard Hammonds book \"As you do...\" which I am really enjoying, you should get it! The result in the end was very good and I went home at the end of the day. Today I will get to find out a little more when I see a Doctor who will debrief me on everything. My Tacrolimus medication has been dropped to 5mg twice a day, as they feel this is probably too strong for me. More later....\n\n## 11th September 2008 - Not long to go...\nAll being well we shall be off to Italy a year from today! So Italy is very much on my mind tonight as I write this. Anyway, in the meantime..... Not much to report today other than the countdown till next Wednesday is rapidly ticking by. Last day of work tomorrow for the best part of two months. Its going to be odd and I am sure I will get bored at some point. Fotrtunately I have got various things in to combat this - Some new books, computer games and a few other things to do to keep me amused plus various outpatients trips after I come out of my initial stay in hospital.\n\n## 12th September 2008 - Taking a break, see you in a few weeks time\nI am going to be taking a break from everything for awhile, as next week I am going to be spending some time in hospital for a major operation and then after that, time to recover. So this is going to be my last post for the foreseeable future. I plan to be back later in the month. In the meantime, take care and thanks for all of your support.\n\n## 20th October 2008 - Creatinine, some more good news\nBrief update to today's diary - My Creatinine has dropped 2 more \"points\" from 177 to 175. Brilliant! However my phosphate level has dropped!!!! Remember the other day, I referred to this course of treatment as being akin to \"medical jenga\", I am now beginning to think how apt that was!\n\n## 22nd October 2008 - It's Wednesday\nToday should be fine and it's now 5 weeks since \"T day\" and my word time has flown by. I already know that my creatinine is down to 175, so today should just be a case of having my blood test done etc and I will learn more on Friday. Shall report on how it all goes later from the hospital. Have a good day! I also hope to fit another walk in later.\n\n## 23rd October 2008 - Giving something back\nI am planning to do something adventurous next year (or maybe 2010). The reason for this is to do some fundraising for SHAK and Kidney Research both of which are charities I hold very close to my heart. It is of course possible to donate money at any time through your own free will. I shall add some links to the footer of this post with details of how you may contact these charities and making donations. I want to become heavily involved in their activities, simply because they have done a monumental amount for me and so many other people, some of whom have been through a far greater ordeal than I have. Its quite staggering to hear stories about people whose kidneys have totally failed, have become entirely dependent upon Dialysis treatment and are still waiting for a matching kidney to become available. I was one of the luckiest people alive, as my story so far has been a relatively straightforward one by comparison to so many others. SHAK supports St Helier Hospital, its Renal unit and patients who go there. Its chaired by David Spensley, who is himself a donor and I shall be writing more about their activities in the future. Anyway what do I have in mind for fundraising? I am going to be deliberately vague for the moment by not giving away too much, as it would be foolish to brag about elaborate plans to climb Everest or that I would love to abseil down the North face of the Eiger. Neither of which are on my list of ideas anyway!!! The ideas I have will involve walking, hiking or cycling some long distance (and well known) routes in the UK or abroad. Heck over the years I may do various things, as I love a little adventure and I am more than happy to challenge myself.... In aid of charity of course! If you have any ideas, please post them here on this blog post, please don't do it via the feed in Facebook, please post them here, so they are all kept together and hopefully trigger off a little discussion.\n\n### Links, notes and other stuff\n\n- [http://www.shak-online.org/](http://www.shak-online.org/)\n- [http://www.epsom-sthelier.nhs.uk/3\\_8.html](http://www.epsom-sthelier.nhs.uk/3_8.html)\n- [http://www.kidneyfund.org.uk/](http://www.kidneyfund.org.uk/)\n- [http://www.renal.org/unit/index.pl?c=sthelier](http://www.renal.org/unit/index.pl?c=sthelier)\n\n## 24th October 2008 - Back to school!\nOr Work if you prefer! The plan is fr me to go back on the 11th November all being well. I am still waiting to cut back from 3 days per week to 2. If that happens next week, I will be going in on Monday and Friday leaving me with 3 days mid week spare. I will beseeing Dr Andrews today who will confirm what the plans are for the next week and when I can start going bak to work. I am just slightly concerned about the fact that my Creatinine hasn't come down as fast as it would normally for people. Rumour has it I may need to do a further 3 day week which may put the schedule back slightly. Lets wait and see. More later!\n\n## 24th October 2008 - 158!\nBreaking News: 158? What could this be about you ask? Let me explain! Dr Andrews has just rung me, literally jut about 10 minutes ago to let me know blood test results are back from this morning. My Creatinine is down from 187 to 158 which is one hell of a drop and also fantastic news, it means that my Kidney has really started to kick in. If you were to plot these figures out on a graph, it would show a clear improvement in kidney function, slow at first, almost rejected but now we have passed that jittery phase and now there are signs, positive signs of great improvement. If this trend carries on next week - No biopsy will be required. Also sorting out my phosphate levels now, as these have dropped dramatically. Pre-transplant they were dangerously high but now it has gone the other way and too far! This does mean that the kidney is doing a stirling job at controlling them but now I will need to take some Phosphate supplements for awhile, which actually taste quite nice, they dissolve in water and they have a good flavour. Have a good weekend, think I have scheduled some posts for the next few days, going to lave the blog on autopilot for awhile, as I am going to go and have some fun!!! Fieworks tomorrow night, may try taking some photos, maybe....\n\n## 24th October 2008 - Friday\nChrist just had an emotional moment thinking about my Dad and what a heroic thing he has done for me recently! I have this thought frequently by the way and normally whilst waiting for my lift to the hospital as my brain warms up for the day and works out its itinerary for the day ahead. Outside its a wet Novembery day even though November is a few days away. I want to hibernate today and not venture outside. Must get some new winter clothes such as a big coat and wellies. I have been feeling the cold recently or am I getting old before my time? Dare I say it, I feel christmassy at the moment! I am bloody looking forward to it this year and I am determined to make it a goodun! I am generally feeling very good but now itching to - drive, return to normal, do some hardcore photography, get away from it all for awhile. It does take it out of you, the constant trips to hospital and occasionally I feel like I am becoming institutionalised. I am of course mega grateful for everything they have done so forgive me if you may interpret that last sentence as a whinge as it wasn't. My wife is starting to feel the strain I think, if only I could whisk her away on holiday right now. I can't though as I am tied at the moment. So yes it can be bloody frustrating. Blood pressure is a little high today. Must give my left arm a break from blood tests next week, it is suffering a bit. Good thing I have a right arm as some people don't! Weight is surprising me as my appetite is fierce, if I don't eat every 5 minutes, I fear death as an imminent possibility! Anyway today I am 75 kilos but I have been having plenty of number twos. Doctor, is that normal? Christ I now need the toilet! Phlebotemists have a great sense of humour. The other day they were talking about kids Tv characters from years back and reminiscing away to their hearts content! I was only moderately concerned that as the nurse inserted the needle into my already blitzed vein, she was impersonating a \"Clanger\"! Question: why are hospital scales \"pessimistic\"? The ones at home are \"optimistic\"! The outcome today is: Creatinine is still misbehaving as it dropped to 178 then 175, the best to date and then the last one leapt to 187. Another biopsy may be needed. However next week I am only coming in on Monday and Friday. Which is brilliant and a step forwards. Still got a long way to go but sod it the weekend is nearly here.\n\n## 28th October 2008 - A brave young man\nI have just been reading in the paper about a brave young man of 15 years who has this year received his second transplant. Even more incredible is the fact that both transplants were donated by both of his parents, his first at around 7 years of age from his Mum and recently his Dad. You can read more about his story at - [http://qblue55.blogspot.com/](http://qblue55.blogspot.com/)\n\n## 31st October 2008 - Friday\nNext week shall be making my own way in here and will have a yellow ticket for blood tests. Well creatinine has bounced up again 20 places to 178. Not ideal and worries me. Tacro levels are fine so on changes needed on that front. Blood pressure is high and now going to add another pill to my collection. Protein levels creeping up. I pray to god this doesnt mean that the FSGS is back and she did ponder over this. I am more than a little panicky right now as you can imagine. Lets also see what blood tests are like today! When will this end? Does it end? Have I become a slave to medical science?\n\n\n\n\n"}]
